PhD Progress Report
--------------------
To Do:
  - Make seamlines + hotspot image
    - Get local image copies of traget area
	- Compare old and new calibration exe's 
	- See if we can smooth borders
	- Make python script to erode boundaries
	- Crop source mosaic to same extent as xcalib mosaic
  - Make MODIS comparison image + think of comments
    - Run gdal mosaic to MODIS res on SunGis08 - use average downsampling
	- Alternatively take spot res mosaic and downsample to MODIS res
  - Make presentation: intro, method, results 20mins + 10min questions
  - Think of more to say on down and upsampling techniques and theory i.e. average is closest to real physical PSF for downsampling, cublicspline smooths which means poorer match to target but desirable from variance / smooth brdf perspective

Understanding to do:
  - why is ds ngi xcalib mosiac look brighter / more contrasty than modis
  - why do we not expect them to match up  
  
  - know the details of the cs ground truth, study area, proposal details.
  - make block diagram of algorithm
  - better way of titling slides

- James concerns: is it automatable and how simple is it.  Apparently I gave him the impression it is complicated and req's a lot of judgement calls.  I think I was trying to stress that the development of the techniques has not been a plug and play sort of excercise.  There is a general attitude that "remote sensing" is a kind of black box and you just need to plug in some images and out pops the information you're looking for.  I was trying to steer him away from this idea.  Remote sensing of env is complex because of so many source of variation and for non-trivial problems will require.  That said with the calib and classification methods established, they will likely not need much modification or none at all to be applied to new areas i.e. it can be done pretty automatically.  
- My response:
  - Currently there are calibration and classification executables which run almost automatically on directories of images.  So the process is quite automatic already i.e. it could easily be run on other sets of images.  
  - The process itself (calibration & classification) required "jusdgement calls" & development of some custom algorithms, esp for calibration.  In the end the techniques are quite simple and now that they are established they can likely be applied to new sets of imagery without modification.  
  - Part of the phd would be to check the extensibility of the calibration and classification techniques to BNR / ECape.  
  - The biggest challenge in rs of environment is that there is so much variation to deal with (phenology, species composition, weather, BRDF).  While the calib and classification techniques are designed to deal with and be independent on this, it is probably unavoidable that there is some dependence on the data used to train the classifier (maybe the seasonal conditions of that year, some aspect of the imaging conditions that hasn't been exactly calibrated for etc).  it would need to be checked if this dependence limits the extensibility of the technique i.e. it would beed to be validated in a new area.  So to extend the techniques to new areas / times would require a validation of their accuracy there.  I expect the calibration to work and the classifier to require retraining.  Currently the classifier retraining would be a fairly manual and fiddly process, a software tool could be made ease this.  
  - But there is context to this which I think is what I was trying to stress in our last meeting: there are many sources of variation to deal with in remote sensing of environment and while calibration and choice of features/measurements used in the classifier endeavour to make things as independent of these as possible, it is unavoidable that there will be some location/time specific dependence.  
  - Let me be real though: one technique that works for all times and places is probably not realistic.  there will need to be some adaptation and validation.  but this would form part of my research and the adaptation can be a relatively simple and fast excercise.  Much easier than field allometry.

I think automating the monitoring makes a lot of sense and is feasible.  I'm a bit sceptical of the practicality of their planting technology though and suspect they have quite a way to go.  Do they have any success stories?  Would automatic planting of small seed capsules be possible or beneficial in a thicket context?  

I'm not sure of the numbers but am thinking that manual planting probably doesn't form such a significant portion of the overall thicket restoration costs. 

 I'm thinking that it's good to create manual planting jobs and that most of the restoration cost is

Do they have any .  I suspect they have a way to go 
  

 Methodological sampling
--------------------------
- Num samples
- Size of plots
- Layout, logisitics and timing of plots wrt remote sensing 
- Other vars to measure, height, sb cc, 

- Det degraded is going to be a lot easier than pristine.  
- Also monitoring of planted vs unplanted is perhaps significant.  


Notes
-----
- Good quality and quantity of data is extremely important for patten recognition / rs 
- Number of samples:
  - More is better of course
  - Representative of strata/classes that are likely to have different relationships betw image pixels and carbon stocks i.e. habitat and level of degradation
  - Per model (class/stratum) we need at least n/d>10, so for say d = 3, we need 30 samples as a bare min per stratum
  - We can create more data by taking many pixels from each sample but these pixels will be correlated due to spatial proximity, so it should not be mistaken for true representivity 
  - What defines a class of consistent / homogenous behaviour remains to be seen i.e. it is not possible to say exactly right now
- There are 2 steps to sampling one is to establish allometric rel.  This can surely only be done with destructive sampling.  The other step is to use allometry for ground truthing plots and for monitoring carbon stocks in restoration sites. 
- Some things have to be destructively sampled / removed as they can be allometried eg. grass, leaf litter, soil.  This is routine.
- Other things can be allomtried but to est the initial allometric rel requires desructive sampling 
- Plot layout should ideally be so that we have precise cs for a precise area i.e. any destructive sampling should either not be done in the main sampling block or it should be small enough so that it is not visible from the air or at least has a negligible effect on the image
- Image spatial accuracy is 5m, sampling plots should be known sub-metre.  And some contextual photo where the plot is visible [i.e. marked with tape] from the air relative to other landmarks should ideally also be taken.  Perhaps with a balloon and gopro.  
- Std's generally aim for <10% error at 95% conf intvl.   So <10% 95% of the time?  My error measures are mean error measures and would probably not satisfy this when variation is accounted for.
- Num samples: n/d>10 where n is num samples and d is dimenstionality or num feats.  so we need say a bare min of 30 samples per "class"/stratum.  I think a class in this context should include stratum like degradation and habitat.  
- It is only on investigating the relationships that I'll be able to say how many samples are really needed but I can say at least 30 per class
- Landscape allometry potentially needs cs for >10x10m.  As plots are used to est cs for larger areas as per methodology, I assume their results can be extrap to neighbouring areas.  Can we be cognisant of this eg choose areas that are likely to be homogenous in cs to ease extrap or at least make some sort of note of likely neighbouring variation.   


To ask
-------
- Where are these plots being done and towards what end
- Which part of 5x5m BNR plots were destructively sampled and how?  Were woody species also taken from these plots?  
- AGB is done with allometry for entire plot? 
- Was canopy height measured - is it a good predictor?
- How do you separate carbon seq due to restoration from that would have been seq (or lost?) anyway
- How is it est with what spatial freq sampling sites should be est?  i.e. the "density"
- Are pristine areas that relevant from my research point of view, we will be restoring degraded areas.  
- I have only budgeted for BNR imagery of MP's plots, I should adjust this if more are needed.  
- What sort of areas are going to be monitored - we're not going to planting in pristine areas, so 
- Differentiate between errors of overest vs errors of underest
- Can plot results be extrapolated eg for landscape allometry
