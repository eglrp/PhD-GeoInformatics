2018 Q4 Planning Take 2
-------------------------
- After Cos reminded me of the importance of applying this thing and looking at ways of extending it over space and time
- This changes the focus from making the current WV3 model as good as possible, to looking at ways of calibrating over space/time, as we already have a pretty decent model
- One way of avoiding lighting/spectral variation (over space/time) is to use height features from a DSM, so we should investigate using an NGI DSM for this.  We could look at pure, DSM features like height/vol difference, texture, finding bare earth pixels with the MS spectral data to tell us where the bottom of the veg is.  
- Another way would be to have quite a simple regression model (say just using r_n), then use some "calibration" plots to fit a linear r_n calibration model between different images.  "Calibration" plots would be ones that have little real change between images eg pristine. 
- As Cos is planning sampling into 2019 Q1, we should stretch our timeline to Q2 too.
- A side task for testing veg volume from DSM would be to see if we measure veg volume/height somehow from Cos' allometric data - is that well correlated with carbon stock?  This then also serves as ground truth for the DSM measurements.

Remaining tasks 
1) Apply differential correction to field DGPS data acquired during Q3&4.					- 1 day 
2) Process field allometric data to produce woody carbon stock (CS) estimates.				- 1 day
3) Perform comprehensive feature selection study.											- 5 days
4) Investigate the correlation between veg volume est and AGB C from allometric data		- 2 days
5) Generate a high resolution DSM of the study area using NGI aerial imagery. 				- 2 days
6) Investigate the possibility of deriving vegetation height/vol features from the above DSM. - 10 days
7) Perform a regression analysis to model carbon stocks from satellite image/DSM features.	- 4 days 
8) Investigate ways of calibrating between NGI and WV3 images / regression models 			- 9 days 
9) Write a report (draft paper) documenting the final carbon stock model.					- 15 days 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total																						- 49 days

- For Q4 lets do 1,2,4,5,6 = 16 days 



2018 Q4 Planning 
----------------

- Tasks + est times 
1) Apply differential correction to field DGPS data acquired during Q3&4.					- 1 day 
2) Process Q3&4 field allometric data to produce woody carbon stock (CS) estimates.			- 2 days
3) Perform comprehensive feature selection study.											- 5 days 
4) Generate a high resolution DSM of the study area using NGI aerial imagery. 				- 2 days
5) Investigate the possibility of deriving vegetation height features from the above DSM.	- 10 days 
6) Perform a regression analysis to model carbon stocks from satellite image/DSM features.	- 10 days 
7) Write a report (draft paper) documenting the final carbon stock model.					- 15 days 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total																						- 45 days

- We have budget for 49 days 

- PhD planning (draft submission for March 2019 should be early Oct which is not going to happen.  Submission for Dec 2019 should be July 2019 which is very doable.  Diss to ext examiners by Aug 19 for Dec grad and 1 Nov for March grad) - I guess I need about 2 months full time to complete the last chapters.  Then we need ~6 weeks between avn and me.  
- Basically, the phd is not going to happen this year and i will have to submit next year round May/June.  So I can afford to focus on GEF exclusively for now, although I think my preference is to keep both going simultaneously.  That way I don't lose touch with either and have the flexibility to shuffle things around a bit.  
- Will GEF actually fund me writing a paper?  
- So if we are going to extend to 2019, it makes sense to leave task 7 and perhaps some of 5/6
- Lets leave tasks 5 & 7 to 2019, that gives 20 days for 2018 and 25 days for 29.  


- If we exclude the last task, then we need to work 24 days (8 weeks at 3 days/week) which is realistic if we are submitting in Dec 

NB see "C:\Data\Development\Projects\PhD GeoInformatics\Code\Results\Budget2018.py" for calcs

- 2018 AWP to do :
  - Shift times and amounts out according to availabiluty of field data 
  - Get a price of WV3 image that can be rectified accurately i.e. can a "standard" georectified image be orthorectified with custom GCP's in PCI or is this like Quickbird?
  
Imagery Notes:
  - DG "basic" imagery is needed to use toutin model 
  - DG basic imagery can only be ordered by scene while "standard" imagery has a min order of 25km2
  - DG Ortho-ready Standard level 2a (ORS2a) imagery can be orthrectified but only with RPC model incl GCP adjustment
  - DG "standard" imagery has already been coarsely warped and cannot be further orthorectified!!!
  - While QB RPC orthorectifcation gives poor accuracy, I have a couple of refernces saying WV RPC orthorectifcation is good (and better than toutin applied to basic imagery)
  - PCI can do the ORS2A RPC rectification with GCP adjustment
  - PCI tutorial: "If the user is supplied with OrthoReadyStandard2A level of data with RPCs, then it is recommended to use RPC modeling instead of Rigorous Modeling"
  
  - I originally budgeted for ~$5000 for fixed costs incl DJI phantom and 136km2 wv-2 of MP's study area 
  
  - to summarise: WV ORS2A is my best bet.  More specifically WV-3 at 30cm is my preference, but I only have a price for archive 50cm from landinfo
  - Worst case is $32.50/km2 for wv-3 30cm, new collect 
  - GEF study area is ~30km2

Timing Notes:
  - Theoretically I should still only be working 2 days/wk while GEF budgeted for 2.5 days/wk in 2018
  - There could be a 6wk delay for new task imagery 
  - We need Cos' data which will only be available 3rd or 4th quarter 
  - I don't won't to work less than budgeted as then I can just lose the budget for those quarters from what I understand, so it is better to spread the budget out and then invoice for any "overtime" / over-budget work done in later quarters.
  - So we should probably push the times out 
  - ONly invoice for imagery / fixed costs in last quarter (in case we don't need the imagery and can use the budget for hourly rates)
  
2018 Imagery costs
------------------
WV-3, new task, 30cm: 30km2 x $32.50/km2 = $960 worst case 
WV-3, archive, 50cm:  30km2 x $14/km2 = $420 "best" case 

Note that this is still substantially less than the $5000 I originally budgeted for fixed costs, so I don't think I can really ask for more money for images 

2018 Timing
------------------
To give me time for papers and Cos for gathering data work something like 1 day/wk for first quarter and 2-2.5 days/week thereafter 

2018 Budget
-----------
My total busget is $22807*13.5 = R307894.5 (from what I can tell which is more or less 2 * R120000pa phd bursary + $5000 fixed costs)
In 2017 I invoiced the following amounts:
  21 July R24300.00
  30 Aug  R41700.00
  12 Dec  R48000.00 (160hrs estimate)
  
which leaves me with ~ R307894.5 - (24300+41700+48000) = R193894.5 for 2018
which converts to 193894.5/300 = 646 hours = 646/7 = 92 days = 92/2 = 46 weeks, which is pretty much the whole year.

Questions
---------
Is that the total budget for me?
Do I charge for the initial study that is part of my phd - if not I can only begin invoicing late in year / next year?
So I don't charge for work already completed?  


Notes
--------
- So my PhD + initial cs time is 8 months - (+ tamboo at 2 months) call it 10 - which takes me to october 
- I have enough time to finish my phd and do the initial study this year, I dont want to commit to anything else. 
- I am likely to work in chunks that averages out to 48hrs/month rather than 12 hrs/wk religiously
- How do I separate out the "free" initial study from the rest of the work?  
- And what about the work I've done?
- Do I bill them for time on the initial study?

- If I don't, do I have enough time in the year to do both their work and my study work?  I would need to complete the initial study before starting any other GEF work, so if I don't bill them for that initial study, I can only start other GEF work well into the year - 
- If I do bill them for the initial study, the timelines are reasonable as we should have the new gt in 2018 to start work on that.  
- Legally, is this ok? - I am being paid for my study time 12 hrs/wk with no IP blabla agreement?  I see nothing wrong.  It does not even qualify as external work - it is more like funding without any IP obligations.
