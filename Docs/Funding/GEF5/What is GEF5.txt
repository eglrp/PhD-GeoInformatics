Main aims
----------
Ecosystem rehabilitation and management 
Increased knowledge and institutional capacity 
Create tools and income source and knowhow for restoration - "Enabling environment for promoting rehabilitation of degraded land through carbon sequestration"
Influence gov - "Enabling environment for promoting rehabilitation of degraded land through carbon sequestration"

Areas
-----
Olifants
Karoo
Macubeni and Baviaanskloof

Specifics
---------
Farming:
------
Ecologically-viable livestock farming, vegetative cover and range resources management for 1300 ha in Macubeni
Capacity-building and -development programme for improving SLM knowledge
Best practices and lessons learned on SLM in the Karoo, Eastern Cape and Olifants landscapes captured and disseminated nationwide
GIS-based information database on socio-ecological systems: degradation, natural resources, livelihoods, resilience; to inform ecosystem restoration and SLM 

Government approved methodology developed for the generation of carbon credits through restoration of spekboomveld
Carbon baseline sampling and assessments undertaken for 200 hectares in the Baviaanskloof
Project Design Document for a community based carbon credit project and assist with diversification of livelihoods. 
Restore degraded spekboomveld to deliver multiple ecosystem benefits
Policy recommendations to mainstream SLM 

Spekboom:
------
Through the Land User Incentive Programme, the government is willing to support 50% of the costs associated with spekboomveld restoration
There are currently two projects with validated Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Project Documents for spekboomveld restoration activities, namely the Addo Elephant National Park, Baviaanskloof Nature Reserve and Great Fish River Nature Reserve Restoration Project and the Kuzuko Lodge Private Game Reserve thicket restoration project. Both of these projects are well poised for earning and generating carbon credits when the voluntary carbon market improves and/or the formal market is established in South Africa. The latter will occur through the promulgation of the carbon tax in 2016.
Finding methodologies appropriate to thicket as CDM VCS etc are not that well suited
Also accreditation costs make it infeasible for small scale farmers to qualify
Still much uncertainty around restoration and carbon trading and getting buy in from pvt landowners - therefore subsidies reqd
"The current priority is to redress the negative impacts of the political history on subsistence farmers"
"83.	In a large, dry country like South Africa, the conservation of ecosystems cannot depend on government funds alone. Local communities need to take responsibility for their livelihood activities; implementing behaviour changes that align with best practice adaptation, as well as natural resource management and conservation priorities. Many of these rural communities need to be empowered to understand climate change and live sustainably in the face of unpredictable changes"
SLM / restoration has been ad hoc - co-ordination is required
"The proposed GEF project will therefore be a catalyst for change. The total baseline is estimated to be US$ 63.83 million. A total of US$ 21,317,042 has been committed as co-financing"

"95.	The DEA initiated the STRP in 2004, building on extensive research – conducted by Rhodes University and Stellenbosch Universities – on the carbon sequestration potential of the Albany Thicket spekboom. The programme aims to provide a financial incentive for the restoration of subtropical thickets while alleviating poverty through the sale of carbon credits"

"1000 hectares of degraded spekboomveld restored in the Baviaanskloof"

Management
----------
"270.	DEA is the Implementing Party for this project on behalf of the Government of South Africa, and DEA will work closely with the DAFF. "
"These Responsible Parties include Rhodes University, the Council for Scientific Research and Industrial Research (CSIR) , and the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT)"
"274.	The duration of the project will be five (5) years."


To Do
-------
Reread my proposal for facts around study areas etc
Read GEF docs
Read contract and prepare questions
Think about timeline
- Finish papers - 2 months
- Acquire and calib imagery - 1 month
- Baviaans feasibility study - 1 month
- Field trip plan - 2 wks
- Field trip exec - 1 month
- CS regression, plant height - 3 months 
- Write up - 3 months 

Contract questions
--------------------
- Just to manage expectations: It is research on challenging problem, there is reason to be hopeful but many challenges remain and I can't guarantee a successful method.  
- I don't intend on being busy until Dec 2018.  Maybe March 2018.  What happens if I finish before then?
- SU owns my IP so the second par of 5. is an issue.  
- 16 In terms of dissemination - is it ok for me to publish paper(s)
- Student expectations part 1) contribute to CDM VCS literature review.  How do you see me contributing to this.  Could I provide input on local context and leave the review to someone else.  Hasn't TK already done this?  I'm not too comfortable about this as it lies outside the scope of my research as currently spec'd. 
- In table 3.1, 3.1b is my only responsibility?


General questions
-------------------
- Carbon baseline sampling and assessments undertaken for 200 hectares in the Baviaanskloof - when
- Please consult me before baselining
- How is baselining done for existing VCS projects
- What happens after the funding has gone
- What are you expecting in progress report
