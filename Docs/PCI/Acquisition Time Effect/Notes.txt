This was an attempt to see if there are systematic differences in colour with time of capture and job
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Images v close in time generally match up
- Sometimes images in the same job have different colours.  They can be fairly close together in time but not sequential.
A rough look suggests this happens more with vegetated land than bare land.
- There are real colour differences in the land (due to topography/geology?).  
This can be a little deceptive as being image differences when the image boundaries are close to the border of the real land change.
- Earlier images (lower sun angle) appear to be greener
- There can be significant colour diffs betw images fairly close in time that are difficult to imagine being only BDRF.
- The N-S bordering lines between 318 and 319 match up remarkably well (better than interspersed images within 
1 of these 2 jobs).  There are 1 or 2 weird colour diffs betw sequential images but on the whole it looks good.

- The above suggests that 318 and 319 did indeed use the same LUT.
- The above also suggests that BRDF is a significant contributing factor to colour differences in a job.
The problem is that these differences seem to be land cover dependent. 

Questions
- Do calibrated images show colour differences over time / betw images
- Do we have precise image capture times?  DMCAngles.log contains times but they are at night ....
